* Coding Conventions

- Prefix: =@= denotes a smart constructor.
- Postfix: =?= denotes a boolean result from a function.
- Postfix: =!= implies that the function mutates its arguments.
- Top-level =defparameter= values are placed in the =package.lisp=.

Otherwise, we keep things simple: just structs and functions. No CLOS, other
than light use of =defgeneric=.

All dependencies are vendored.
