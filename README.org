| Blob      | Every 2s  | (level * 40)/5000 |
| Tank      | Every 3s  | (level * 25)/5000 |
| Evil Ship | Every 5s  | 16/5000           |
| Building  | Every 5s  | 16/5000           |

* Coding Conventions

- Prefix: =@= denotes a smart constructor.
- Postfix: =?= denotes a boolean result from a function.
- Postfix: =!= implies that the function mutates its arguments.
- Top-level =defparameter= values are placed in the =package.lisp=.

Otherwise, we keep things simple: just structs and functions. No CLOS, other
than light use of =defgeneric=.

All dependencies are vendored.
